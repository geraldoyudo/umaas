This folder contains an example html page that shows how Traverson works with AngularJS via traverson-angular. You need to start the test server with `node bin/start-test-server.js`, which serves index.html and the static assets as well as the REST API that is used in the example. Then open the URL `http://localhost:2808/static/browser/example/index.html` in your browser and click on the "Start Request" buttons to see traverson-angular in action (hint: keep an eye on the network tab in the dev tools to see what's going on).
